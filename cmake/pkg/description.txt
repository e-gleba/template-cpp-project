A clean, modern C++ project template designed for robustness and cross-platform compatibility.
This template streamlines setup for new projects, featuring secure environment variable handling,
system information gathering, and minimal, UNIX-style logging.
It leverages the latest C++23 standards, explicit error handling, and modular design
to minimize boilerplate and maximize maintainability.

Ideal for rapid prototyping, CI/CD pipelines, and production-ready applications.
Includes cross-platform support for Windows and Unix-like systems,
with clear separation of concerns and no unnecessary dependencies.
